Description: remot3.it is a cloud service that provides secure connections to 
 your networked devices across the public internet, even those located behind 
 cellular connections. remot3.it is like a private VPN service for networked 
 devices, making support, maintenance and management easy - even eliminating 
 costly 'truck rolls'.  
 remot3.it is compatible with most devices with a TCP/IP stack; simply add a  
 small daemon and configuration files, and it will be instantly available for 
 a secure connection.  The APIs and portal allow for easy 'bulk' management 
 of devices in the field.
